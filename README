ifilter
=======
Basic image color filters.

ifilter reads an image from standard input, applies a color filter
and dumps the resulting image to standard output.

Available color filters are:
- grayscale
- sepia
- invert
- shade
- tint

usage: ifilter [-f factor] [grayscale|sepia|invert|shade|tint]

Note: factor is used for the shade and tint filters and ignored otherwise.
